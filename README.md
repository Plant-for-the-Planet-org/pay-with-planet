Welcome to the Donation Gateway that powers the [Plant-for-the-Planet Platform](https://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/). You can make donations to restoration organizations, plant trees and support forest conservation.

Donate with Plant-for-the-Planet relies on the Plant-for-the-Planet Open APIs. The Foundation takes no commission from donations made through the gateway, however payment portal fees eg: Stripe, PayPal will still apply.

Donations made through the application are tax deductible in several countries and can be managed from the Plant-for-the-Planet account.
